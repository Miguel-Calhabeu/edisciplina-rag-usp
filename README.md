# e-Disciplinas File Downloader - Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that automatically downloads all files from e-Disciplinas course pages with intelligent organization.

## Features

- 🚀 **One-Click Download**: Download all files from a course page instantly
- � **Smart Organization**: Automatic organization by custom directory and course code
- �📥 **Automatic File Naming**: Preserves original file extensions (`.pdf`, `.docx`, etc.)
- 🔗 **Advanced URL Detection**: 9-strategy system handles complex redirect chains
- ⚙️ **Persistent Settings**: Configure download directories that persist across sessions
- 🤖 **Course Auto-Detection**: Automatically extracts course code from page
- 🎨 **Beautiful UI**: Clean, intuitive interface with settings page
- ✅ **Manifest V3 Ready**: Modern Chrome extension architecture

## How It Works

### File Detection & Download Flow

1. **Scan Page**: Finds all resources with class `aalink stretched-link` linking to `/mod/resource/view.php`
2. **Extract URLs**: Uses 9-strategy system to reliably extract actual file URLs:
   - Direct pluginfile URLs in response
   - Full pluginfile URLs in HTML
   - Relative pluginfile paths
   - Meta refresh redirects
   - JavaScript location changes
   - Data attributes
   - Download links
   - File extensions
   - Generic pluginfile URLs
3. **Preserve Extensions**: Automatically extracts and appends file extensions from URLs
4. **Organize Files**: Applies user settings for directory structure
5. **Download**: Uses Chrome's download API with proper file organization

### Download Organization

Files are automatically organized as:
```
~/Downloads/[custom-path]/[course-code]/[filename].[ext]
```

**Examples:**
- Default: `~/Downloads/e-Disciplinas/SSC0534/Aula1.pdf`
- Custom: `~/Downloads/courses/2025/SSC0534/Slides.pptx`
- Root: `~/Downloads/SSC0534/Trabalho.docx`

## How Files Are Extracted

### 9-Strategy URL Extraction System

The extension uses multiple strategies to reliably find download URLs:

1. **Direct Redirect**: If fetch follows redirect to pluginfile, use that URL
2. **Full URL Search**: Find `https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/...` in HTML
3. **Relative Path**: Convert relative `/pluginfile.php/...` to absolute URL
4. **Meta Refresh**: Extract URL from `<meta http-equiv="refresh">`
5. **JavaScript Redirect**: Find URL in `location.href = "..."`
6. **Data Attributes**: Search for `data-href`, `data-src`, `data-url`
7. **Download Links**: Find `<a>` tags with pluginfile URLs
8. **File Extensions**: Look for direct links to `.pdf`, `.docx`, etc.
9. **Generic Search**: Last resort - find any pluginfile URL

### File Extension Preservation

- Extracts extension from final download URL
- Appends extension to filename: `Aula1` + `.pdf` = `Aula1.pdf`
- Normalizes to lowercase: `.PDF` → `.pdf`
- Handles URLs with query parameters: `file.pdf?token=xyz` → `pdf`
- Fallback if no extension found: uses filename as-is

## Troubleshooting

### Files Not Downloading

**Problem**: "Initiated 0 file download(s)"
- Make sure you're on an e-Disciplinas course page (https://edisciplinas.usp.br/course/view.php)
- Verify course has files visible
- Check browser download permissions are enabled

**Problem**: Files download but without extensions
- Extension has been updated to v1.1.1
- Reload at `chrome://extensions/` (click 🔄)
- Try downloading again

**Problem**: Some files missing
- Large course pages may take time to process
- Check Downloads folder for successfully downloaded files
- Look for error messages in popup status

### Configuration Issues

**Problem**: Settings not saving
- Reload extension at `chrome://extensions/`
- Verify Chrome storage is enabled (Settings → Privacy)
- Try resetting to defaults in settings page

**Problem**: Course code not detected
- Some page layouts may not expose course code
- Can manually disable "Create course subfolder" in settings
- Files will organize by custom path only

### Permission Issues

- Extension requires `downloads` permission to save files
- Grant permission when prompted by Chrome
- Check extension permissions at `chrome://extensions/`
- Verify host permission for `https://edisciplinas.usp.br/*`

## Permissions Explained

| Permission | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `activeTab` | Access current active browser tab |
| `scripting` | Inject content scripts to detect files |
| `downloads` | Programmatically trigger file downloads |
| `storage` | Save user settings persistently |
| `host_permissions` | Limited to `https://edisciplinas.usp.br/*` |

## Development

### Local Testing

1. Make changes in `chrome-extension/` folder
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Click reload button (🔄) on extension
4. Changes take effect immediately

### File Organization in Development

- **Extension Code**: `chrome-extension/` folder
- **Documentation**: `Documentation/` folder
- **Version Control**: Git repository with full history
- **Gitignore**: Excludes `.DS_Store`, IDE files, environment variables

│   └─ Extracts: course code from page
│
├─ content.js (Runs on page)
│   ├─ Find resources
│   ├─ Fetch resource pages
│   ├─ Extract URLs (9 strategies)
│   ├─ Extract extensions
│   └─ Send to background worker
│
└─ background.js (Service Worker)
    ├─ Receives download request
    ├─ Load user settings
